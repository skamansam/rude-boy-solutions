### "Skaman Sam"  Samuel C. Tyler
I began my career as a web developer in 1996 and have watched closely as the web has expanded and grown to be as inclusive and 
ubiquitous as it is today. I have learned many technologies and proggramming languages over the years, all with a focus on web 
application development.
